          The Enterprise Course Catalog (ECC) enables a global search capability
          that pulls information from decentralized local catalogs across the
          DoD and aggregates the content into a single, Defense-wide portal.
          Existing course catalog systems and their respective contents will
          still be owned and managed by their current system owners, but the
          content (data) within those systems will be discoverable across all of
          DoD via the ECC portal.{' '}
